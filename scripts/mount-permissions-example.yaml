# Example mount-permissions.yaml
# Place this file alongside compose.yaml in each container directory
# to have permissions applied automatically before starting containers.
#
# Format:
# mounts:
#   /path/to/mount:
#     mode: "755"          # Optional: numeric mode (e.g., "755", "644", "700")
#     owner: "user:group"  # Optional: owner in user:group format
#     recursive: true      # Optional: apply recursively (default: false)
#
# All fields are optional. If a field is omitted, that permission won't be set.
